Warthog Speed Booster - Documentation
Overview
The Warthog Speed Booster plugin enhances WordPress site speed by implementing caching, script minification, and lazy loading for images. It’s an easy-to-use plugin developed by ShopsFargo to optimize loading times and improve user experience.

Features
Browser Caching: Increases site speed by storing static resources in the browser for faster future access.
Script Minification: Reduces the size of JavaScript and CSS files, which helps pages load more quickly.
Lazy Loading: Only loads images when they are about to come into view, reducing initial page load time.
Installation
Download the Plugin: Download the plugin from your source as a .zip file.
Upload to WordPress:
Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard.
Navigate to Plugins > Add New.
Click Upload Plugin and choose the .zip file for Warthog Speed Booster.
Activate the Plugin: Once uploaded, click Activate Plugin to enable it on your site.
Usage
The Warthog Speed Booster is designed to work automatically. After activation, it will begin optimizing your site right away:

Browser Caching: Automatically sets a caching policy for browsers to store resources.
Script Minification: Minifies JavaScript and CSS files on the fly, making pages smaller and faster.
Lazy Loading: Adds loading="lazy" attributes to images, which reduces page load time by deferring image loading.
Settings
Currently, there are no additional settings or configurations needed. The plugin works out of the box with default settings optimized for most sites.

Troubleshooting
1. Changes Not Reflected
Clear your browser cache or any caching plugins installed on your site.
Verify the plugin is active by going to Plugins in the WordPress dashboard.
2. Compatibility Issues
Ensure you’re using the latest version of WordPress.
If conflicts arise with other plugins, try deactivating them one by one to isolate the issue.
3. Image Loading Issues
If images are not loading as expected, it might be due to lazy loading. Try adding the data-skip-lazy attribute to any image tag that should load immediately.
